                        In connection with your application for employment with MK Freight Inc (“Prospective Employer”),
                        Prospective Employer, its employees, agents or contractors may obtain one or more reports
                        regarding your driving, and safety inspection history from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
                        Administration (FMCSA).
                        <br> <br>
                        When the application for employment is submitted in person, if the Prospective Employer uses any
                        information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse
                        employment decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer will provide you with a copy of the
                        report upon which its decision was based and a written summary of your rights under the Fair
                        Credit Reporting Act before taking any final adverse action. If any final adverse action is
                        taken against you based upon your driving history or safety report, the Prospective Employer
                        will notify you that the action has been taken and that the action was based in part or in whole
                        on this report.
                        <br><br>
                        When the application for employment is submitted by mail, telephone, computer, or other similar
                        means, if the Prospective Employer uses any information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to
                        not hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding you, the Prospective
                        Employer must provide you within three business days of taking adverse action oral, written or
                        electronic notification: that adverse action has been taken based in whole or in part on
                        information obtained from FMCSA; the name, address, and the toll free telephone number of FMCSA;
                        that the FMCSA did not make the decision to take the adverse action and is unable to provide you
                        the specific reasons why the adverse action was taken; and that you may, upon providing proper
                        identification, request a free copy of the report and may dispute with the FMCSA the accuracy or
                        completeness of any information or report. If you request a copy of a driver record from the
                        Prospective Employer who procured the report, then, within 3 business days of receiving your
                        request, together with proper identification, the Prospective Employer must send or provide to
                        you a copy of your report and a summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
                        <br><br>
                        Neither the Prospective Employer nor the FMCSA contractor supplying the crash and safety
                        information has the capability to correct any safety data that appears to be incorrect. You may
                        challenge the accuracy of the data by submitting a request to https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov. If
                        you challenge crash or inspection information reported by a State, FMCSA cannot change or
                        correct this data. Your request will be forwarded by the DataQs system to the appropriate State
                        for adjudication.
                        <br><br>
                        Any crash or inspection in which you were involved will display on your PSP report. Since the
                        PSP report does not report, or assign, or imply fault, it will include all Commercial Motor
                        Vehicle (CMV) crashes where you were a driver or co-driver and where those crashes were reported
                        to FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, all inspections, with or without violations, appear on
                        the PSP report. State citations associated with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR)
                        violations that have been adjudicated by a court of law will also appear, and remain, on a PSP
                        report.
                        <br><br>
                        The Prospective Employer cannot obtain background reports from FMCSA without your authorization.

                        release of safety performance information including crash data from the previous five (5) years
                        and inspection history from the previous three (3) years. I understand and acknowledge that this

                        State, FMCSA cannot change or correct this data. I understand my request will be forwarded by
                        the DataQs system to the appropriate State for adjudication.

                        FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, I understand all inspections, with or without violations,
